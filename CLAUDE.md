# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a newly initialized project named "natlang" (natural language) with no source
code yet. The only existing files are IntelliJ IDEA configuration files.

## Development Notes

- The project appears to be related to natural language processing based on the directory name
- There is a reference to a related project "machine_dialect" in the IDE configuration
- No build system, dependencies, or source code have been established yet

## Getting Started

When implementing this project, consider:

1. Choosing an appropriate programming language for NLP tasks (Python is common for ML/NLP)
1. Setting up a proper project structure with source, tests, and documentation directories
1. Establishing a build system and dependency management
1. Creating a README.md with project description and setup instructions

## Common Tasks

Since this is an empty project, common development tasks will need to be established based on the
chosen technology stack and project requirements.
