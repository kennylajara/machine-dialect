Define `fibonacci` as Interaction.
It takes `n` as Whole Number.
It gives back a Whole Number.

If `n` is less than or equal to _1_:

> Give back `n`.

Otherwise:

> Define `n_minus_1` as Whole Number.
> Set `n_minus_1` to `n` minus _1_.
> Define `n_minus_2` as Whole Number.
> Set `n_minus_2` to `n` minus _2_.
> Define `fib_1` as Whole Number.
> Call `fibonacci` with `n_minus_1` and store in `fib_1`.
> Define `fib_2` as Whole Number.
> Call `fibonacci` with `n_minus_2` and store in `fib_2`.
> Define `result` as Whole Number.
> Set `result` to `fib_1` plus `fib_2`.
> Give back `result`.

Define `n` as Whole Number.
Set `n` to _40_.

Define `result` as Whole Number.
Call `fibonacci` with `n` and store in `result`.

Say `result`.
